# CL-Collector
This is a small project I've undertaken to mostly learn some Node and Mongo basics. Its purpose is to scrape Craigslist posts and save them to a Mongo database. Eventually I'd like to include a dashboard with realtime updates through websockets, live analysis on the data, and alerting mechanisms.
